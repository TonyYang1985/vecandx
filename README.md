Update dependencies
Before migrating your packageâ€™s code, update its dependencies to null-safe versions:

> Run dart pub upgrade --null-safety 
to upgrade to the latest versions supporting null safety. Note: This command changes your pubspec.yaml file.

Run dart pub get.
> dart pub get

We recommend fixing the analysis issues before running `dart migrate`.
Alternatively, you can run `dart migrate --ignore-errors`, but you might
get erroneous migration suggestions.
